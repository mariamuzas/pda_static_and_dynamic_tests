### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.
# There are 6 errors in total. 

```python

class CardGame:
      
  # The name of the method in this class must be written in snake_case (underscore between words) and not CamelCase(capital letter for each word).
  def checkforAce(self, cards):   
  # this should be a loop to check if in the cards that you have you have any ace. 
    # there should be 2 equals: if card.value == 1:
    if card.value = 1:
    # True and False need to be first letter capitalize. 
      return true
    # there is no need of else statement, but the return for False needs to be outside the conditional for the loop that should be here keep looking through all the cards until it finds an ace, and don't stop as soon as hits a card that is not an ace. 
    else        
      return false

# There are 3 errors in the next line, "dif" should be "def", there is no comma between the last 2 parameter variables, and a colon is missing at the end.
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2)  
  #  The colon are missing after the if and else statement. 
    if card1.value > card2.value  
      return card
    else
      return card2
 
# the method need to have self as first argument: def cards_total(self, cards)
 def cards_total(cards): 
#  The next line needs to be define as a list: total = 0 
# This way all the values for each card in cards will be added to the variable total, as the method is design for. 
   total     
   for card in cards:
     total += card.value
     return "You have a total of" + total
